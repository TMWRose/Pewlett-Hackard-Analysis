## Summary


1. How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?


2. Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

- Of the 499,999 people within the company, 41,380 are retiring. That's 8.3% of employees, which is not an insignfigant amount of people especially considering most of retirees are in Senior and Management positions. **The HR department should make it a priority to develop an upcoming retirement alert system internally to better track when these positions will need to be filled.** There should be systems in place to ensure the company isn't suprised by another "silver tsunami" in the future.

- There should be tables of the retirees for each department to send to all of the department heads, not just Sales and Development. The heads of these departments need this information to plan their business operations around the retiring employees. It would be wise for HR to equip the department leads with the information on an annual or semi-annual bases to ensure the departments have enough time to plan for new hires. If they are told last minute every time then the turnover might start to negativly impact projects and day-to-day operations.

## Summary


1. ***How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?***

There are an estimated 41,380 employees retiring, which means about that number of open roles will need to be filled.

2. ***Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?***

Of the employees retiring, only 1,549 are eligible to be mentors. That's only 3.7% of all retirees available to train the next generation of senior staff/managers, which is more than likely not enough.  

- Of the 499,999 people within the company, 8.3% are retiring which is not an insignfigant amount of people. **The HR department should make it a priority to develop an upcoming retirement alert system internally to better track when these positions will need to be filled.** There should be systems in place to ensure the company isn't suprised by another "silver tsunami" in the future.

- There should be tables of the retirees for each department to send to all of the department heads, not just Sales and Development. The heads of these departments need this information to plan their business operations around the retiring employees. **It would be wise for HR to equip the department leads with this information on an annual or semi-annual basis to ensure the departments have enough time to plan for new hires**. If they are told last minute every time then the turnover might start to negativly impact projects and day-to-day operations.
